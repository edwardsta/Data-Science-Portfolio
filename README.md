# Data Science Portfolio

A collection of data science projects that I've created over the years. Some of these projects were completed as part of academic coursework, others for continuing education, and some just for kicks.

## Contents

### Natural Language Processing
* [Deep Learning Sentiment Classifier, RNN-LSTM:](https://github.com/edwardsta/sentiment-classifier-rnn-lstm) Predict the sentiment, positive or negative, of a movie review using a deep learning binary classifier. The sentiment classification task is accomplished using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM) architecture. Python, Keras, Tensorflow.

### Machine Learning
* [Simple linear regression:](https://github.com/edwardsta/simple-linear-regression) A supervised learning problem using gradient descent to optimize the cost function J(Î¸). Predictions of profit are made for a food truck company based on the population of the cities where they may wish to operate a new franchise.
* [Multiple linear regression:](https://github.com/edwardsta/multiple-linear-regression) Same approach as simple linear regression but with multiple variables and feature normalization. Predictions of a house's market value in Portland, OR are made using a linear regression model trained on size (square footage), and number of bedrooms.


### Data Analysis and Visualization

### Python

### R
