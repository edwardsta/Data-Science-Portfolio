# Data Science Portfolio

A collection of data science projects that I've created over the years. Some of these projects were completed as part of academic coursework, others for continuing education, and some just for kicks.

## Contents

### Natural Language Processing
* [Deep Learning Sentiment Classifier, RNN-LSTM:](https://github.com/edwardsta/sentiment-classifier-rnn-lstm) Predict the sentiment, positive or negative, of a movie review using a deep learning binary classifier. The sentiment classification task is accomplished using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM) architecture. Python, Keras, Tensorflow.
* [A Simple NLP Preprocessing Pipeline:](https://github.com/edwardsta/simple-nlp-pipeline) An example showing how a function can be used to create a preprocessing pipeline for common natural language processing tasks. This example defines a function 'preprocess()' which will perform sentence and word tokenization, part of speech tagging, and named entity chunking on input text.
* [Custom Tokenization using Regular Expressions:](https://github.com/edwardsta/tokenization-regular-expressions) Provides a simple example showing how regular expressions can be used to create custom tokenization rules. This example defines a regular expression which is passed to the nltk.RegexpParser method to demonstrate how we can create custom text parsing.

### Machine Learning
* [Optical Character Recognition via Neural Network:](https://github.com/edwardsta/optical-character-recognition) A multi-class classifier is developed using a neural network to recognize handwritten digits. The model was trained using backpropagation on a dataset of 5000 examples. The predict.m file uses feedforward propogation to classify the input image, and is able to recognize handwritten numbers, 0-9, with an accuracy of 97.5%.
* [Gaussian Anaomoly Detection for Server Computers:](https://github.com/edwardsta/gaussian-anomoly-detection) An anomaly detection algorithm is implemented to detect anomalous behavior in server computers. Using measures of server throughput, latency of response, and a several other variables, a Gaussian distribution of server behavior is created to identify outliers.
* [Simple Linear Regression:](https://github.com/edwardsta/simple-linear-regression) A supervised learning problem using gradient descent to optimize the cost function J(Î¸). Predictions of profit are made for a food truck company based on the population of the cities where they may wish to operate a new franchise.
* [Multiple Linear Regression:](https://github.com/edwardsta/multiple-linear-regression) Same approach as simple linear regression but with multiple variables and feature normalization. Predictions of a house's market value in Portland, OR are made using a linear regression model trained on size (square footage), and number of bedrooms.

## More to Come...
There are so many projects that I've completed, but aren't yet listed on this site. Some of the items that you can expect to find as I update this portfolio include the following.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
### Python
### R
